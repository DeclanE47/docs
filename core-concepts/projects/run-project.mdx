## Build project workflow with states

Issues within a project can transition through various states to reflect the progression of work in your project. This movement of issues through states constitutes the project workflow.

### State groups

Plane provides five sets of state groups to categorize all your project states:

- **Backlog**: Useful for issues not yet prioritized by project members. Issues in this group require more work or discussions before they move forward. Plane creates a default state in this group called "Backlog".
- **Unstarted**: Useful for issues planned to be picked up by project members. Issues in this state represent upcoming work for members. Plane creates a default state called "To-do" in this group.
- **Started**: Useful for issues picked up by project members. Issues in this state represent work that is currently happening in your project. Plane creates a default state called "In-progress" in this group.
- **Completed**: Issues in this state represent completed work in your project. Plane creates a default state called "Done" in this group.
- **Cancelled**: Issues in this state represent cancelled work in your project. Plane creates a default state called "Cancelled" in this group.

### Add, edit or remove states

Each state group can contain multiple states, which can be created and ordered according to your project's workflow. These options can be found under the States tab inside Project &gt; Settings.

To add a new state, click on the "+" button beside the state group of your choice. After adding the state, you can rearrange it with other states in the group.

You can also choose to mark the state as the default for the project to ensure all new issues without a state are assigned to this state.

To remove a state, ensure no issues are assigned to the state you want to remove.

## Define estimates

Estimates aid in communicating the workload associated with each issue. By default, no estimates are added to your project. You can access these options under the Estimates tab inside Project &gt; Settings.

### Estimate

An estimate comprises an ordered set of points used to quantify the amount of work in an issue.

Here are the attributes of an estimate:

- **Name**: Name of the estimate group.
- **Description (optional)**: Details about the estimate group.
- **Points**: An ordered set of strings or numbers assigned to your issues. You need to add all 6 points before creating an estimate.

Once an estimate is created, you can choose to mark it in use for your project. Once marked, the points in the estimate become available for members to use.

You can add multiple estimates and change the estimate in use to seamlessly migrate to a different estimate type.

<Note> Currently, estimates are limited as each point is treated as a category internally, preventing accurate insights on your work. We'll be changing this soon.</Note>

## Manage labels

Similar to states, labels on projects aid in filtering, differentiating, and categorizing issues within your project. You can create and control as many issue labels as needed.

<Note> Labels can also be created directly from the issue detail page.</Note>

You can access these options under the Labels tab inside Project > Settings.

## Connect integrations

## Set up automations

Within your project, you can set up automations to perform the following tasks:

1. **Auto-archive closed issues**: You can configure an automation to archive issues that are closed in your project based on a customizable time period. Once set up, the automation will move all issues matching the time period to archives.

2. **Auto-close issues**: You can configure an automation to close issues that are open in your project based on a customizable time period. Once set up, the automation will move all open issues matching the time period to the selected closed state.
