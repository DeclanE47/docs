## About Plane One
There are a few points to remember about Plane One
1. Plane one is available only to self-host. If you are looking for our cloud version, please check [here](/introduction/quickstart).
2. Plane one only works if you have a domain, it will not work with IP addresses or localhost. If you are trying out plane and don't want to commit to one yet, checkout our [self-hostable community edition](/self-hosting/overview).
2. Plane one comes with updates for the next 2 years. Your Plane instance will always be up-to-date with our auto-update option.
3. Plane one works well for upto ~100 users. If you have more than 100 users in your instance, you should consider moving to [our Pro plan](https://plane.so/pricing).
