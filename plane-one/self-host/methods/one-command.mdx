Plane One is our first licensed self-hosted edition for growing teams. One unlocks security, governance, and project management features scale-ups need to manage their instance and projects better.

### Getting your Plane One license

If you have already purchased a Plane One license, go to app.plane.so/one and use the same email address you used at the time of purchase to log in.

To find the email address used, look for an email from `@plane.so` or Stripe with the subject, `Your One license`.

If you have successfully logged in, you should see a list of your licenses. Clicking any will show you your license info and the command you should copy to start deploying One.

Deploy plane one with a single command across any cloud provider console.

## Deploying Plane One
### Pre-requisites
- You have a virtual machine with at-least 2 vCPUs and 4 GB RAM
- Your CPUs are x64 AKA AMD 64 or AArch 64 AKA ARM 64.
- You are running Ubuntu, Debian, or CentOS. For Amazon Linux 2 or Linux 2023, click here.

## Upgrading from Community Edition to One

### Backing up your data
`setup.sh` in the Community Edition now comes with an option to back up your data.

1. Use  `./setup.sh` to open the operator menu and select `7` to backup your Plane data.
2. When done, your data will be backed up to the folder shown on the screen.
e.g., `/plane-selfhost/plane-app/backup/20240522-1027`
3. This folder will contain 3 `tar.gz` files.
    - `pgdata.tar.gz`
    - `redisdata.tar.gz`
    - `uploads.tar.gz`
4. Copy all the 3 files from the server running the Community Edition to any folder on the server running Plane One **** on any folder of your choice
e.g., `~/ce-backup`

### Restoring your data to your One instance
1. Start any command-line interface like Terminal and go into the folder with the back-up files.
    ```
    cd ~/ce-backup
    ```
2. Copy and paste the script below on Terminal and hit Enter.
    ```
    
      TARGET_DIR=/opt/plane/data
      sudo mkdir -p $TARGET_DIRfor FILE in *.tar.gz; do
      if [ -e "$FILE" ]; then
              tar -xzvf "$FILE" -C "$TARGET_DIR"
          else
              echo "No .tar.gz files found in the current directory."
              exit 1
          fi
      done

      mv $TARGET_DIR/pgdata/ $TARGET_DIR/db
      mv $TARGET_DIR/redisdata/ $TARGET_DIR/redis
      mkdir -p $TARGET_DIR/minio
      mv $TARGET_DIR/uploads/ $TARGET_DIR/minio/uploads/
    ```
3. This script will extract your Community Edition data and restore it to /opt/plane/data.
4. Follow the instructions for new installations below.

## New installations
1. `ssh` into your machine as the root user (or user with sudo access) per the norms of your hosting provider.
2. Run the command below with the last twelve characters being your license key.
```
    curl -fsSL https://prime.plane.so/install/YOUR-LICENSE-KEY | sh -
  ```
<Tip>The easiest way to get this command is from the customer portal where you will get your license key from. Each entry on the portal shows the command bound to the license key, so you could just copy it from there.</Tip>
  
Successfully running that command,
1. Validates the license key
2. Downloads `prime-cli` per your OS and your CPU's architecture and saves it to the `/usr/bin` directory.
3. Runs the `prime-cli setup` command with necessary parameters. which in turn -
    1. Asks you for the domain to link the license to. Choose this carefully. The domain linked to the license can't be changed later.
    2. Asks you to setup Plane in express or advanced mode. Express is the fastest way to setup Plane. Advanced setup lets you configure all services on your own.
    2. Installs Docker and its necessary plugins.
    3. Downloads the license file.
    4. Downloads `docker-compose`, `plane.env`, and the images for the microservices that will run in the Docker network.
    5. Downloads the required docker images.
    6. Starts the Plane Services.

Once complete, you can simply open the domain you have configured in the setup of Plane one and start using Plane.
