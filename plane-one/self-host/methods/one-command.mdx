## Pre-requisites
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="A virtual machine with at-least 2vCPUs and 4GB RAM.">
    You can choose a virtual machine from any cloud provider of your choice. Just make sure they have atleast 2vCPUs and 4GB of RAM. 
    We only support the following operating systems
    - Ubuntu
    - Debian
    - CentOS
    - Amazon linux 2023
    - Amazon linux 2

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="A publicly listed domain managed by you.">
    We will also need a public domain which is pointed to the IP virtual machine you have chosen. Currently Plane one doesn't support localhost or IP based installations.

## Steps
Log in to Virtual Machine as per the command provided by the cloud providers terminal and then run the below command by replacing YOUR-LICENSE-KEY with the license key you purchased.

```
curl -fsSL https://prime.plane.so/install/YOUR-LICENSE-KEY | sh -
```
This command will do the following
- Validates the license key
- Based on the OS and CPU Architecture, downloads our command line interface(Prime cli) to setup and manage your plane one instance.
- Start the prime-cli setup command with required parameters.

Once Prime cli is installed, then it performs the following steps
- Ask user for the domain name (to be) linked to the license. <b>Domain Name cannot be modified once linked to the license.</b>
- Select a way of installation, express and advanced. Choose express if you don't want to configure any additional details for your setup.
- Install Docker and required plugins.
- Downloads the License File.
- Downloads the required assets to install and run Plane instance ie docker-compose, plane.env, docker images.
- Starts Plane one on the connected domain.

Once complete, you can simply open the domain you have configured in the setup of Plane one and start using Plane.
