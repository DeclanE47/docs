8. **Configure Jira**:  
    1. Select the workspace and the project from where you want to import data in the **Select Jira Workspace** and **Select Jira Project** lists.
    2. For **How do you want to record issue types in Plane?**, choose an option to define how issue types in Jira should be imported to your Plane project.
        - **Create as a label** - Imports issue types in Jira as [Labels](https://docs.plane.so/core-concepts/projects/run-project#manage-labels) in Plane.
        - **Add [ issue_type ] in the title** - Prefixes the issue type to the Issue title in Plane.   
        *Example*: **[TASK] Blitz with dev team** where **TASK** is an issue type in Jira.

    You can choose one of the following options:
    - **Upload CSV**: Click the **Upload CSV** button to import the users to your Plane project. Refer to [Export users from a site](https://support.atlassian.com/organization-administration/docs/export-users-from-a-site/) to download the CSV file from Jira. *(recommended)* 
    - **Skip user import** - You can select the **Skip Importing User data** checkbox and manually add users after the import process.
        <Warning>If you skip user import, issues and comments added by any user will display the name of the user who performed the migration. The Assignees field will be empty.</Warning>
